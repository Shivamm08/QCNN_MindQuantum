# QCNN_MindQuantum

This project is an implementation of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN) for two datasets:
1) The Iris Dataset (classification of flowers based on features like sepal length/width and petal length/width)
2) The Breast Cancer Dataset (binary classification of malignant vs. benign samples)

The project leverages the MindQuantum library for encoding classical data into quantum circuits and implementing hybrid quantum-classical neural networks. The work was completed as part of the Value-Added Course on Quantum Machine Learning (VAC2406) at VIT Chennai, in collaboration with KwantamG Research Labs.
